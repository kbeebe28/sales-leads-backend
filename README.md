# Sales Leads Project

## Instructions for running application
`git clone https://github.com/sfonua10/sales-leads-backend.git`\
`npm install`\
`npm run dev` to start web server

NOTE: while node server is running, open another terminal session and run these commands: \
`cd client`\
`npm install`\
`npm run dev`\
visit http://localhost:3000/

## Notes:
I decided to stick with the tech stack Manta uses -- Node.js and React. Create-react-app starter. Tailwindcss for styles. Opinionated styles based on rules of the "buying likeliness indicator". Jest testing library for scripts in sales-leads-backend repo.
