# Sales Leads Project

## Instructions for running application

To start web server:
### `git clone https://github.com/sfonua10/sales-leads-backend.git`

### `npm install`

### `npm run dev` 

NOTE: while node server is running, open another terminal session and run these commands: \

### `cd client`

### `npm install`

### `npm run dev`

visit http://localhost:3000/

## Notes:
I decided to stick with the tech stack Manta uses -- Node.js and React. Create-react-app starter. Tailwindcss for styles. Opinionated styles based on rules of the "buying likeliness indicator". Jest testing library for scripts in sales-leads-backend repo.

If I had more time, I would finish validation rules, refine secret algorithm, stand up the node server, rtl and ltr support, etc
